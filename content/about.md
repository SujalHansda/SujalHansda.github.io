I'm Sujal, a B.Tech undergraduate from IIT Kharagpur. I'm your friendly neighborhood developer. Most of my time I write code that fails to build in a CI/CD pipeline. But you know *It works on my machine*. My biggest fear is prod database migration.
Currently I am learning about open-source and am trying to contribute by spell-checking documentations.

In moments of relaxation, I indulge in the melodic realm of music and digital art.
I also play Valorant just to mess up with my mental state and die right after spawn.
