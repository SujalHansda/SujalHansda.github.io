I'm Sujal, a B.Tech undergraduate from IIT Kharagpur. I'm your friendly neighborhood developer. Most of my time I write code that refuses to build in a CI/CD pipeline. But you know *It works on my machine*. My biggest fear is prod database migration.
Currently I am diving the depths of open-source and trying to contribute by spell-checking documentations.

In moments of relaxation, I indulge in the melodic realm of music or digital art.
I also play Valorant just to mess up with my mental state and trash talk people while being bottom fragger.
