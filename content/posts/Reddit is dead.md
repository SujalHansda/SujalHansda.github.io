Well the day is near when those Reddit moderators gonna have to step outside, ladies and gentlemen. But Reddit moderators have always been wild to me, working for free to keep the site up that gives you nothing in return while having the highest opinion of yourself is the weirdest form of human evolution that I've ever seen.

Now, Reddit, if you've been trying to access it today, is dead. You know why? Basically, Reddit is charging for API access, meaning that everyone that uses their API to create a third-party application or really anything is going to have to be paying an exorbitant amount of cash over what they used to do.

Now, paying for APIs, that's not new. Twitter had started to do so as well, and I think a lot of these websites have started to look at charging for API access, especially with the rise of ChatGPT and all these LLM models, because they're just afraid that they're going to get completely hounded. They're going to get completely thrown into the ground by having the value of their dataset diminished by a lot of these new emerging companies. Then again, I also don't really see the point of all of this because clearly these LLM models are actually accessing the data even without touching the API and so on and so forth. Maybe I am getting way too ahead of myself. Well the true goal is corporate greed.
They don't want their traffic to third party apps. The most popular and best third party app, Apollo , would have to pay Reddit $20 million a year just to keep Apollo running, earlier which was completely free!


To whittle it on down, back to Reddit. The largest subreddits have gone down. Now, to understand how Reddit works, Reddit is a website. The subreddits are actual entire, I guess you could say, forums, that have their own individual discussion. So, for instance, r/LinuxGaming will talk about Linux gaming, r/India will talk about India.

Today all the subreddits went private, the entirety of Reddit is currently going through some intense server load, trying to privatize every one of those posts, possibly user accounts, lists, and so on. I also believe their recommendations algorithm might be getting completely messed up given the fact that the largest subreddits that it was pooling from are just no longer accessible. So it's probably digging up from some obscure subreddit that nobody's ever heard of until now because it's the only one that's publicly accessible.

According to a Twitch stream 7,243 out of 7,806 subreddits have gone private. As of now or unitll they resolve dispute with the third party developers, Reddit's not worth going to even if it was functioning because without these subreddits, without the content, what's the point of connecting to one of the largest social media platforms. The protest seems to be only for 48 hrs. But reddit CEO says that the blackout will eventually pass and hence not to worry about. We should go indefinitely. F*** corporates, these dudes can't even make a proper app, can't even make a video player...
